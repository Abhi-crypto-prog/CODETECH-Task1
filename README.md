OVERVIEW OF THE BASIC CALCULATOR PROJECT
OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly calculator program using Python. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) by inputting two numbers and selecting an operation.

KEY ACTIVITIES
Defining Functions for Arithmetic Operations:

Develop individual functions for each arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Ensure that each function takes two numerical inputs and returns the correct result.

User Interaction:

Implement user prompts to collect input numbers and the desired operation.
Display a menu of available operations and handle user input to select the operation.

Error Handling:

Incorporate error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric entries and division by zero.
Provide user feedback for incorrect selections and prompt re-entry when necessary.

Result Display:

Calculate the result based on the user-selected operation and input numbers.
Display the result in a clear and concise manner.

Script Execution Control:

Ensure the program runs only when executed directly by using the __name__ == "__main__" construct.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Programming Language: Python
Python is chosen for its simplicity and ease of use for basic scripting tasks.
Standard Input/Output:
input(): Used for collecting user input.
print(): Used for displaying messages and results to the user.

SUMMARY
This project demonstrates the creation of a basic calculator using Python. The calculator performs fundamental arithmetic operations and handles user input and errors effectively, providing a solid foundation for understanding basic programming concepts and user interaction in Python.
